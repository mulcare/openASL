#ASL 14 - Silence that Gun

##Rules to Review
###Demolition Charges (__A23__)
The American player gets one DC in his order of battle. Because the German player gets to designate the ground level of one building as fortified, you may want to wait until you figure out which building is fortified and attempt to create a Breach (__B23.9221__)

Another tactic to consider is using your Hero to carry the DC. He has a higher morale than your squads, and more MF, making him more likely to maneuver into position to place the DC.

###Bazookas (BAZ) (__C13.4__)
There are four BAZ44 in the American order of battle. BAZ are most useful against AFVs, but can still be useful against infantry, given that they attack with 8FP on the IFT. However, before attacking on the IFT, a BAZ shot must score a hit on its To Hit table (on the back of the counter, and below):

| Range | TH# |
|:------|----:|
|0      |   11|   
|1      |    9|
|2      |    8|
|3      |    7|
|4      |    4|

As noted in __B13.42__ there are further DRM to be added to the TH roll, including things like TEM. Essentially, you want to be very close to your target when firing to have any chance of scoring a hit on them.

Also important to note are the rules on Backblast (__C13.8__). A unit that fires his BAZ from a building must either add the Case C3 DRM (+2) to his TH roll, or take a Desperation penalty (__C13.81__). You don't want to take a Desperation roll unless you are truly desperate--it's ugly.

###Fortified Buildings (__B23.9__)
One Victory Condition for the Americans is that they solely occupy the Fortified Building that the Germans secretly designate at the start. You should be familiar with the different ways you can and cannot get inside a fortified building.

###Infantry SMOKE (__A24__)
The Elite American units all have a Smoke Exponent of 3, making laying SMOKE something to actually consider. Furthermore, Americans have the ability to use White Phosphorus (__A24.3__) which not only hinders fire but causes units in the hex where the WP is placed to take a NMC with various modifiers. This can be very powerful if used correctly.

Note that unlike Ordnance SMOKE, which stays around for several turns, Infantry SMOKE is removed from the board after the MPh in which it is place.

###Spraying Fire (__A7.34__ and __A9.5__)
The American squads and the MMGs have an underlined Range factor, meaning they have the ability to use Spraying Fire. This allows the American player to fire on two different hexes at the same time, albeit at half firepower in each.

###Underlined Morale (__A1.23__)
The underlined Morale factor of the American squads indicates that they have an ELR rating of 5, and if they experience ELR failure, they will split into two broken half squads rather than reduce in quality.
