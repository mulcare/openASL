<b>openASL README</b>


The openASL project is an open source, collaborative guide to learn
Advanced Squad Leader (ASL). This project was originally created by
Ross Mulcare due to his finding that the available ASL materials were
lacking in one way or another. The materials in this project are meant
to be highly readable for beginning ASL players, but also as useful
refreshers for more advanced ASL players.

As this project grows, Ross and I would love to see a collaboration of
ASL players submitting pull requests to submit new material, enhancing
existing material, or forking this master project in an attempt to create
even more customized Advanced Squad Leader guides and player aids.


<b>What is ASL?</b>


Advanced Squad Leader has been the standard in tactical combat since
its 1985 debut. A thriving community of ASL players extends throughout
the world. No other game matches its flexability, scope, and challange.
Players can simulate nearly any battle in any theater up to the battalion
level. Maneuver 10-man squads, 5-man half squads, and individual leaders
and vehicles across a combination of over 68 geomorphic map boards
or fight a campaign on one of several highly detailed campaign game
map sheets.

<b>File Organization and Structure.</b>

To make things as cleanly simple as possible every topic will be organized
within its own directory structure: 

<ul>
        <li>Specific topics will be sorted and organized within their own
        directory (e.g. all topics regarding portage will be located in the Portage directory)</li>
        <li>Scenario_Notes: Scenario notes, sceario help files, scenario tutorials, and scenario FAQs will we be sorted by name, and placed within their own
directory underneath the Scenario_Notes folder.</li>
        <li>Scenarios: Individual scenarios will be
placed within their own directory underneath the Scenarios folder.</li>
        <li>Tutorials: Tutorials will be sorted by name, and placed within their own directory underneath the
Tutorials folder.</li>
</ul>

When uploading new files please try to use the most descriptive filename as
possible, and avoid using blank spaces between words in the filename.

Files within these directores will fall under these standardized file formats when
possible:

<ul>
        <li><i>filename.md</i> - GitHub's markdown format</li>
        <li><i>filename.txt</i> - Plain-text formatting</li>
        <li><i>filename.tex</i> - LaTeX formatting</li>
        <li><i>filename.dvi</i> - LaTeX compiled file</li>
        <li><i>filename.pdf</i> - Portable Document Format</li>
        <li><i>filename.xls</i> - Microsoft Excel formatting</li>
        <li><i>filename.doc</i> - Microsoft Word formatting. Note, please try
        and restrict the use of Microsoft Word whenever possible.</li>
        <li><i>filename.nfo</i> - Plain-text file describing what topic is
        being discussed in detail.</li>
   
</ul>
