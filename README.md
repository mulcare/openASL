openASL README


The openASL project is an open source, collaborative guide to learn
Advanced Squad Leader (ASL). This project was originally created by
Ross Mulcare due to his finding that the available ASL materials were
lacking in one way or another. The materials in this project are meant
to be highly readable for beginning ASL players, but also as useful
refreshers for more advanced ASL players.

As this project grows, Ross and I would love to see a collaboration of
ASL players submitting pull requests to submit new material, enhancing
existing material, or forking this master project in an attempt to create
even more customized Advanced Squad Leader guides and player aids.


What is ASL?


Advanced Squad Leader has been the standard in tactical combat since
its 1985 debut. A thriving community of ASL players extends throughout
the world. No other game matches its flexability, scope, and challange.
Players can simulate nearly any battle in any theater up to the battalion
level. Maneuver 10-man squads, 5-man half squads, and individual leaders
and vehicles across a combination of over 68 geomorphic map boards
or fight a campaign on one of several highly detailed campaign game
map sheets.
